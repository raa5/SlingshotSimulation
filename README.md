Welcome to this python simulation for a spacecraft slingshot arouns Jupiter.

How to use:
1. After running the .py file, a window will pop up with Jupiter in the center
2. Click anywhere on the screen to indicate start position of the spacecraft and draw to indicate velocity of the spacecraft
3. Letting of the mouse will cause the spacecraft to move in a trajectory defined by the initial conditions (set by the user) and the gravitational interaction forces between Jupiter and the spacecraft
4. The top right box will display the velocities in x, y, and the escape velocity of the spacecraft instantaneously
5. Enjoy!
